This Python script automates the process of scraping data from company homepages, processing it through AI-powered prompts, and organizing both raw and processed data in Google Sheets.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main script orchestrating data scraping, processing, and organization tasks.
- `utils/` directory:
    - `data_manager.py`: Contains a `DataManager` class for data retrieval, manipulation, and updating in Google Sheets.
    - `data_scraper.py`: Defines a `DataScraper` class for scraping content from HTML web pages and cleaning text data.
    - `prompts_sequence.py`: Provides templates and functions to generate prompts for AI-based processing of data.
- `./.env.example`: An example environment file template for API keys and endpoints.
- `./data/` directory: Stores output data files generated by the project.
- `requirements.txt`: Contains the list of Python dependencies required for the project.

## Usage

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Fill in actual API keys and endpoints in the `.env` file based on the provided template.
3. Run the `main.py` script.

## Output

The main script `main.py` will scrape data from company homepages, process it through AI-powered prompts, and organize both raw and processed data in Google Sheets. Processed data will also be saved in CSV format in the `./data/` directory.
