Kaneka Americas is live on the Unvired Mobile Rounds Manager and the Unvired Warehouse Management mobile apps (that integrate with SAP) which have enhanced our Asset Maintenance and Shipping processes. Another major reason for selecting Unvired is its team of skilled individuals who understand both SAP and Mobility and are able to identify business opportunities. We found Unvired to be flexible, cost-effective, and responsive while delivering on time. We regard them as our extended team. Cody Cupp CEO- UNEE Group We are extremely pleased with the level of support we receive from Unvired. As a valued business partner, they provide us the necessary, expert resources needed to deliver our own solutions and products. And we find the Unvired team to be flexible and responsive. For example, we have leveraged Unvired’s Drag & Drop Form Builder to quickly deliver mobile form-based applications as well as leveraged Unvired for other integration assistance into our own Utility Management System product. Karl Hoffower Executive Director- Failure Prevention Associates, LLC We deployed the Unvired Turbo Forms app on our iPad and Android tablets to collect asset information in the field for electric motors, gearboxes, fans, compressors, pumps, etc. This was for Inspections of physical asset condition and verifying key information (asset class, rpm, horsepower, and coupling type). Knowing this information helps with asset condition monitoring, failure mode diagnosis, and executing work orders. This year we decided to kill paper. Having to manually search through paper files was time-consuming and difficult. This app has made our lives much easier. Now, we quickly pull up any asset-related information when we need it. MIKE LAMB CIO- WEL Networks At WEL Networks we are always looking at innovative ways to deliver the best in safety and service. This trial was extremely successful and it gave our executives hands-on experience with the Unvired application before selecting Unvired and Cirrotec as our mobile solution providers. Having the ability to approve purchase orders away from their desks simplifies and streamlines the PO approval process, driving commercial efficiencies. In addition to the Workflow App, we are also deploying the Unvired mobile EAM app for Windows 10 tablet for our field workforce, integrating with SAP Plant Maintenance. SILJI ABRAHAM CIO- Sigma Aldrich (now Merck) Unvired’s Mobile App for SAP CRM incorporating Sigma-Aldrich enhancements has been rolled out to the global field sales force in US, EMEA and APAC regions in 9 languages. The unified CRM mobile application provides instant access to Leads, Opportunities, Account Planning & Forecasting, Pre-sales, Marketing, Sales and Customer Intelligence leading to increased sales force productivity. We have found the Unvired team to be very responsive, knowledgeable and have delivered a meaningful solution to meet our needs. CARSTEN GANN SAP Very deep and strong domain expertise in SAP mobile solutions. Strong delivery capability leveraging a mix of on-site and off-shore resources to ensure the optimal outcome for clients.

CHRIS PANG Head of Speakeasy Studio- Carlton & United Breweries We contracted the Unvired team to deliver a promotional Chatbot engine.

When I first started the store, I had no idea what I was getting into or the time it would require from me. It was clear pretty quickly I was not going to be able to keep up and I definitely needed help. Minnu has been a life saver, keeping up on the day to day and always keeping me informed on what is going on with the store. She is fantastic at responding to customers and the replies are always timely and professional. If you are a busy professional like myself, let the Utopian team help you, you won't regret it.

To no fault of Utopian's there have been issues with Amazon and deactivations that we have dealt with. The team has been on top of each issue working diligently to solve each problem. If I could give higher that 5 stars I would! DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS? FAQs What is a Virtual Assistant (VA)? A VA is usually a remote offshore team member who you can hire at a significantly lower cost than a local employee. Our VAs are fully trained to provide customer care, manage your e-commerce store and complete administrative tasks on your behalf. You don’t even have to ‘hire’ them as employees, we provide a no commitment monthly subscription service. What kind of businesses do you work with? We work with business owners who sell on Amazon or Shopify. We cover businesses who are dropshipping, operating a FBA or FBM store or are private labelling their products. Some of our clients are just starting out, while others are well-established and generating millions in revenue each year. Why should I work with you over hiring my own staff? Utopian VA is uniquely positioned in the market to provide cost-efficiency and high performance in managing day-to-day operations for Amazon or Shopify stores. We intimately understand the needs of our clients and specially train our staff to be able to fulfil them expertly. You won’t have the headache of hiring, training and retaining staff on your own. We protect you from increasing overhead costs more than they need to be AND we are more affordable than the average virtual assistant service. How quickly do VAs reply to my messages? As we work in a virtual environment, we believe in overcommunication to ensure smooth operations. Our clients enjoy the level of communication and speed of response their VA provides and regularly praise this aspect of our service in the online reviews they post about our company. How good is the VAs' English? English proficiency is a basic requirement for recruitment and all our team members have successfully completed university education. Should you feel unsatisfied with your VA’s level of English proficiency, please do not hesitate to reach out and we will replace your VA. What happens if I’m unsatisfied with my VA’s performance? First, we would appreciate if you give the VA’s team leader the opportunity to have a conversation with you to understand exactly which aspects of the VA’s performance you are unsatisfied with. We will retrain the VA to remedy these aspects, but if you are still not satisfied afterwards, we are happy to provide a replacement free of charge. Can your VAs cater to my local time zone? We can cater towards North American and European time zones. Most of our current clients are based in the United Kingdom, USA, Canada and South Africa. How are you different from other VA agencies? Our clients appreciate that we are specialized in the e-commerce industry, whilst other agencies jump on many different industries at the same time. We operate our clients’ businesses like our own and are intimately familiar with the usual problems in e-commerce businesses. On top of that we tailor our services to each client and adjust our processes to fit into their business. We don’t just recruit VAs for your business, like other agencies do, but we train and manage them as well. For you it is just a simple monthly subscription, saving you the bureaucracy that comes with regular employment. How do I get started? Contact Us and we will have a free consultation to understand your specific business needs, to find out if we can help you. Quick Contact !
